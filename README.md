# Hi! Nice to meet youüëã
## I'm currently studying web development

**what am I studying now?**
1. next js
2. react
3. deep js
4. start TypeScript


### **My skills**
|skill|ownership percentage|
|-|--------|
|react|20%|
|html|70%|
|css|70%|
|js|45%|
|vue js|40%|
|gulp|50%|


### Coolness?
1. Every day I learn something new
	> Regularity is the only secret of success!
2. Communication?
  > You don't have to understand every person! You can either accept it or not.
3. Relaxation?
  > Maybe there is no point in straining?


###### We'll see you again üòâ

> Today I‚Äôll write down a thought here... I wonder if it‚Äôs true that if you do something every day for 30-60 minutes for several years, a person will easily achieve success in this matter...

> A funny day... I practiced English, comprehended some unthinkable things, and of course practice writing code. The Internet just isn't buzzing today... if nothing happened, where would you be?

### Good evening! There will be no access to a computer for a couple of days, but we will not stop studying and repeating. These days I‚Äôll add here the points that I‚Äôll study, and maybe a couple of ideas!
1. Today we remembered prototypical inheritance in JS. Yes, quite a useful technology. It‚Äôs cool that there is extensibility... of course, don‚Äôt forget that today I read a book in English and repeated the words. Quite a productive day combined with active recreation! Good nightüòã
2. Good evening! Today we discussed the topic of working with memory when using methods and prototypes in a constructor. Yes, it is useful to remember such information. And
 it will even be useful to me! p.s. I'll attach some code for fun.



'''

function Character(name, health) {
  this.name = name;
  this.health = health;
}

Character.prototype.greet = function() {
  console.log("–ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç! –ú–µ–Ω—è –∑–æ–≤—É—Ç " + this.name + ".");
};

let characters = [];

for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  characters.push(new Character(`Character ${i}`, 100));
}

console.log(characters);
'''
3. Great evening! Today we repeat the dynamic update. I‚Äôm writing a little late, but of course I don‚Äôt forget about studying. Think about the difference between discipline and motivationüòã
