# Hi! Nice to meet you👋
## I'm currently studying web development

**what am I studying now?**
1. next js
2. react
3. deep js
4. start TypeScript


### **My skills**
|skill|ownership percentage|
|-|--------|
|react|20%|
|html|70%|
|css|70%|
|js|45%|
|vue js|40%|
|gulp|50%|


### Coolness?
1. Every day I learn something new
	> Regularity is the only secret of success!
2. Communication?
  > You don't have to understand every person! You can either accept it or not.
3. Relaxation?
  > Maybe there is no point in straining?


###### We'll see you again 😉

> Today I’ll write down a thought here... I wonder if it’s true that if you do something every day for 30-60 minutes for several years, a person will easily achieve success in this matter...

> A funny day... I practiced English, comprehended some unthinkable things, and of course practice writing code. The Internet just isn't buzzing today... if nothing happened, where would you be?

### Good evening! There will be no access to a computer for a couple of days, but we will not stop studying and repeating. These days I’ll add here the points that I’ll study, and maybe a couple of ideas!
1. Today we remembered prototypical inheritance in JS. Yes, quite a useful technology. It’s cool that there is extensibility... of course, don’t forget that today I read a book in English and repeated the words. Quite a productive day combined with active recreation! Good night😋
2. Good evening! Today we discussed the topic of working with memory when using methods and prototypes in a constructor. Yes, it is useful to remember such information. And
 it will even be useful to me! p.s. I'll attach some code for fun.

```

function Character(name, health) {
  this.name = name;
  this.health = health;
}

Character.prototype.greet = function() {
  console.log("Привет! Меня зовут " + this.name + ".");
};

let characters = [];

for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  characters.push(new Character(`Character ${i}`, 100));
}

console.log(characters);
```

3. Great evening! Today we repeat the dynamic update. I’m writing a little late, but of course I don’t forget about studying. Think about the difference between discipline and motivation😋

4. Hello! We continue to study the advantages of prototypes. Today, flexibility and modularity are the order of the day. In general, take a look at the example ✌️

```
function Mage(name, health, spell) {
  Character.call(this, name, health);
  this.spell = spell;
}

Mage.prototype = Object.create(Character.prototype);
Mage.prototype.constructor = Mage;

Mage.prototype.castSpell = function(target) {
  console.log(this.name + " произносит заклинание " + this.spell + " на " + target + ".");
};

let mage = new Mage("Маг", 80, "Огненный шар");

mage.attack("Монстр");  
mage.castSpell("Враг");
```

5. Great day! Tomorrow I will move on to more difficult practice. We will write code using object prototypes. I think I'll be able to post the sketches tomorrow. Just like that... Should I take care of business? Have a nice evening, buddy💪

6. Cool day! Today I mostly rested and practiced. Repeated Vue js. We were talking about styles and classes. Back to code tomorrow! Good luck guys ✌️
7. Interesting day! Lots of interesting experiences. It is worth thinking about hardness and softness. What is better at a distance...
8. Anger! Force! Breaking point... To be reborn, you must die...
9. It's a great day! Played a mind game. Good progress😁 Repeated Vue Js a bit. Tomorrow to coding. Have a nice weekend!

> ¡Buenas noches niños y niñas! Hoy se apagó Internet, así que actualicé un poco la teoría. Mañana editaré este archivo si vuelve Internet😋 Por cierto, tengo algunas noticias y pensamientos interesantes😁 ¡Quizás incluso los veas aquí algún día!
