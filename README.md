# Hi! Nice to meet you👋
## I'm currently studying web development

**what am I studying now?**
1. next js
2. react
3. deep js
4. start TypeScript


### **My skills**
|skill|ownership percentage|
|-|--------|
|react|20%|
|html|70%|
|css|70%|
|js|45%|
|vue js|40%|
|gulp|50%|


### Coolness?
1. Every day I learn something new
	> Regularity is the only secret of success!
2. Communication?
  > You don't have to understand every person! You can either accept it or not.
3. Relaxation?
  > Maybe there is no point in straining?


###### We'll see you again 😉

> Today I’ll write down a thought here... I wonder if it’s true that if you do something every day for 30-60 minutes for several years, a person will easily achieve success in this matter...
